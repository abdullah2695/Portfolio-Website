# Portfolio Website Handover Document

## Project Overview

I've created a modern, responsive portfolio website for Abdullah Ahmed Abdo with the following features:

- **Modern Design**: Using the requested color palette (#2C3E50, #34495E, #7F8C8D, #BDC3C7, #ECF0F1)
- **Enhanced Visual Elements**: Less minimalist design with cards, gradients, and visual elements
- **Responsive Layout**: Fully responsive on all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- **Contact Form**: Integrated with Formspree with toggle functionality
- **Easy Content Editing**: All content stored in separate data files

## Live Website

The website is now live and can be accessed at:
